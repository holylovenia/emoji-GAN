# emoji-GAN
In this assignment, you’ll get hands-on experience coding and training GANs. This assignment is divided into two parts: in the first part, we will implement a specific type of GAN designed to process images, called a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). We’ll train the DCGAN to generate emojis from samples of random noise. In the second part, we will implement a more complex GAN architecture called CycleGAN, which was designed for the task of image-to-image translation (described in more detail in Part 2). We’ll train the CycleGAN to convert between Apple-style and Windows-style emojis. In both parts, you’ll gain experience implementing GANs by writing code for the generator, discriminator, and training loop, for each model.
